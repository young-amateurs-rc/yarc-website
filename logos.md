The Young Amateurs Radio Club has several versions of their logo, for use in different contexts. All logo designs are copyright the Young Amateurs Radio Club. Members may use them, but not modify them.

All logos are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/young-amateurs-rc/yarc-logos)

## Large Logo

Use this when the 'WY4RC' is large enough to easily read.

## Promotional Logo

The Large Logo can also include the YARC web address.

## Small Logo

Use this when the 'WY4RC' in the Large Logo is not reasonably readable.

## Monochrome Logo

Use this in simple and monochrome contexts (e.g. print). It should only be used in the official white and black colors.
