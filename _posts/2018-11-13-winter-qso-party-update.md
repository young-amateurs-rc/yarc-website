A week ago, we here at [YARC](https://YARC.world) announced our Winter QSO Party Sponsored by [Hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org), with $625 in prizes available. We wanted to encourage youth to get OTA, and get older hams excited about getting OTA with the youth by offering prizes that our winners could use to purchase new equipment to enhance their ham radio experience. We're following up the original contest rules and announcement with some exciting changes!

To ensure that our contest is in the spirit of amateur radio, we’ve switched from cash prizes to gear. 

**The “$25” category winners are now eligible to choose one of the following prizes from this pool:**

* NooElec SDR Bundle

* BaoFeng UV5R

* 1 SignalStick + 1 HamStudy.org shirt 

**The “$75” category winners are now eligible to choose one of the following prizes from this pool:**

* 2019 ARRL Handbook Softcover Edition + 2 SignalSticks

* 146-3 Arrow II Hand Held Portable Yagi Antenna 

* QCX QRP Transceiver Kit + 2 SignalSticks

As before, your station must have a median age at or below 30 in order to be eligible for prizes. If you're over that age, **we encourage you to find local young hams and get them involved in your station!** More information regarding scoring & prize categories and eligibility and can be found in [the contest rules](https://yarc.world/events/contests/2018/09/18/winter-qso-party-2018/). 

***Please share this with everyone so they’re aware of the changes to our contest!***
