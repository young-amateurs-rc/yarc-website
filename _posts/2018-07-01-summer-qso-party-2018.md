## Contest Period

**Begins**: 2018-07-28 at 16:00 UTC
<br/>
**Ends**: 2018-07-28 at 21:59 UTC

**Can’t find anyone on the air? Join our [Discord server]({{site.discord}}) and see who is spotting in the #qsos channel.**

## Objective

To introduce young amateur radio operators to radiosport and encourage young amateurs to get on the air. **All stations may participate, but stations with a majority (greater than 50%) of operators over the age of 30 may only submit check-logs.**

## Exchange

When calling CQ, use “CQ YARC” or similar to show you’re calling for this contest.

The exchange must be made over radio. Exchange your QTH and Four-Digit Year Licensed. If using a club callsign, use the year the club was founded.

QTH: The 2 letter abbreviation of your US State, Canadian Province/Territory, or DX. See below for a listing of all abbreviations. The WY4RC stations will give YARC# as their QTH, where # is a number 0 to 13.

## Scoring

The formula for scoring is:
```
QSO Points = 3 * (# of Phone QSOs) + 2 * (# of CW QSOs) + 1 * (# of Digital and Internet QSOs)
Total Score = QSO Points * QTH Multiplier * Bonus Multiplier
```
If the Bonus Multiplier is 0, do not include it in the calculation.

# **QSO Points**
Each Phone contact is worth 3 points.

Each CW contacts is worth 2 points.

Each Digital or Internet-Linked contact is worth 1 point.

You may work any one station exactly once on each mode and band combination, for a maximum of 31 QSOs per station (3 modes, 10 bands, plus Internet-Linked). Although there is no credit for duplicate contacts, there is no penalty either, so please do not remove them from your log, as they help with log checking.

# **Multipliers**
Each US State, Canadian Province/Territory, and DX (non-US or Canada) are multipliers, for a maximum of 64. See the bottom of this page for a complete listing of multiplier QTHs.

Working any WY4RC station: Your bonus multiplier is the number WY4RC stations (WY4RC or WY4RC/#) worked. You may work each WY4RC station once on each band and mode combination. The WY4RC stations will give YARC# as their QTH, where # is a number 0 to 13.

The active WY4RC stations will be:
 - WY4RC/0, operated by KE0QHA
 - WY4RC/4, operated by AB3NJ

## Modes

CW (Log as **CW**): Morse code

Phone (Log as **PH**): Upper and Lower Sideband, FM

Digital (Log as **RY**): all commonly used modes, except for JT modes (JT9, JT65, FT8, WSPR, etc).  Additionally, internet-linked modes (DMR, Echolink, and IRLP) are allowed.  Remember [repeater etiquette](http://www.qsl.net/riafmrs/Repeater_Etiquette.html) if using these modes through a repeater.

## Bands

160, 80, 40, 20, 15, 10, 6, 2, and 1.25 meters, and 70 centimeters.

Log the band/frequency of any Internet-linked QSOs as **“INET“**.
