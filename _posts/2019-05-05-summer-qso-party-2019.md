# Contest Period

**Begins**: 2019-08-24 at 16:00 UTC (12:00 ET)  
**Ends**: 2019-08-25 at 03:59 UTC (00:00 ET)

**Can’t find anyone on the air? Join our Discord server and see who is spotting in the [#qsos-and-contesting channel](https://discord.gg/7RSC5Dm).**

# Objective

To introduce young amateur radio operators to radiosport and encourage young amateurs to get on the air. To encourage old timers to contact as many young operators as possible. **All stations may participate, but stations with a median operator age of over the age of 30 submit in their own category.**

# Exchange

Over-30 stations may only work under-30 stations. Under-30 stations may work everyone. 

Recommended CQ calls:

Over-30: use `CQ YH` on CW/RY/DG and `CQ Young Hams` on phone to call for under-30 stations.

Under-30: use `CQ YARC` to show you’re calling for this contest. 

The exchange must be made over radio. Exchange RS(T) plus your QTH, which is the 2 letter abbreviation of your US State, your Canadian Province/Territory, Mexico, or DX. See [below](#exchange-qth-listing) for a listing of all abbreviations.

# Scoring

The formula for scoring is:
```
QSO Points = 1 * (# of Phone QSOs) + 2 * (# of CW QSOs) + 3 * (# of Digital QSOs)
Total Score = QSO Points * Multiplier
```

## QSO Points
Each Phone contact is worth 1 points.  
Each CW contacts is worth 2 points.  
Each Digital contact is worth 3 point.

You may work any one station exactly once on each mode and band combination, for a maximum of 30 QSOs per station (3 modes, 10 bands). Although there is no credit for duplicate contacts, there is no penalty either, so please do not remove them from your log, as they help with log checking. 

Contacts with an incorrectly copied callsign or exchange will not count toward the total QSO points. 

Contacts with a entered age greater than to 30 will be removed from all over-30 entries during log checking.

## Multipliers

Each US State, Canadian Province/Territory, Mexico, and DX (non-US, Canada, or Mexico) are multipliers, for a maximum of 65. See [below](#exchange-qth-listing) for a complete listing of multiplier QTHs.

# Modes

CW (Log as **CW**): Morse code  
Phone (Log as **PH**): Upper and Lower Sideband, FM  
Digital (Log as **RY** or **DG**): all commonly used modes, except for WSJT modes (JT9, JT65, FT4, FT8, WSPR, etc). JS8 *is* allowed.

# Bands

160, 80, 40, 20, 15, 10, 6, 2, 1.25, and 0.70 meters.

# Entry Classes

All assisted operation, including self-spotting, is allowed for all entry classes. 

**Each category further splits into under- and over-30 categories. Stations with a median age greater than 30 compete in the over-30 category.**

## Single Operator

| Category           | Code   | Maximum Power | # of Transmitters | # of Operators |
|:-------------------|:-------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------------|
| Single, High Power | SO-HP  | Legal Limit   | 1                 | 1              |
| Single, Low Power  | SO-LP  | 200 Watts     | 1                 | 1              |
| Single, QRP        | SO-QRP | 15 Watts      | 1                 | 1              |

## Multi-Single

| Category                 | Code   | Maximum Power | # of Transmitters | # of Operators |
|:-------------------------|:-------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------------|
| Multi-Single, High Power | MS-HP  | Legal Limit   | 1                 | 2+             |
| Multi-Single, Low Power  | MS-LP  | 200 Watts     | 1                 | 2+             |

**Only one transmitted signal on one band permitted during any 10-minute period (run station/signal). Exception: One — and only one — other transmitted signal (multiplier station/signal) may be used during any 10-minute period, if — and only if — it is on a different band from the run transmitter and the station worked is a new multiplier. The run and multiplier transmitters are governed by independent 10-minute rules. Ten-minute periods begin with the first QSO on a band. The log must indicate which station/signal (run or multiplier) made each QSO. The multiplier station/signal may not call CQ (solicit contacts).**

## Multi-Multi

| Category                | Code   | Maximum Power | # of Transmitters | # of Operators |
|:------------------------|:-------|:--------------|:------------------|:---------------|
| Multi-Multi, High Power | MM-HP  | Legal Limit   | 2+                | 2+             |
| Multi-Multi, Low Power  | MM-LP  | 200 Watts     | 2+                | 2+             |

## Special Awards Categories

Special awards will be given to the station who scores the highest in each of the following special categories. They are overlay categories, so enter according to the above entry classes and you may also qualify for one of the School Club or New Contester awards:

### School Club
School entries must use the appropriate school call sign or, if operating as a YARC special event station, the special event callsign issued by YARC. School entries must operate from the campus station, if one exists. Any school club member may operate including students, faculty, staff, and alumni, provided that the average age of all operators is under 30. A School Club may enter in any under-30 category. Use the "School" category in your log.

### New Contester
Open to any under-30 Single Operator station who can attest to have participated in 3 or fewer contests. A New Contester station in Single Operator Low Power and QRP categories only. Use the "Rookie" overlay category in your log.

###  Worked All YARC
Any station who works all YARC special event stations at least once during the contest period will receive a "Worked All YARC" certificate.  
The active YARC stations will be:
- To Be Announced

## Checklog
Entry submitted to assist with the log checking. The entry will not have a score in the results and the log will not be made public.

## Prizes

To Be Announced.

# Log Submissions

Logs are due on **2019-08-31 at 23:59 UTC**

Logs must be e-mailed directly to [contests@yarc.world](mailto:contests@yarc.world) in Cabrillo format. A web form to generate a Cabrillo-formatted log can be found [here](http://www.b4h.net/cabforms/yarcqp_cab3.php). When emailing the
log, the **subject line should be the callsign used on the air and the log should be attached as** `callsign.log`.

# General Rules for All Entrants

1. A different call sign must be used for each entry. Only the entrant’s call sign may be used to aid the entrant’s score.
2. Do not exceed the total output power limitation of the chosen entry category on any band. Total output power on any band at any time is measured at the output of the active amplifier(s).
3. Remote operation is permitted if the physical location of all transmitters, receivers, and antennas are at one station location. A remotely operated station must obey all station license, operator license, and category limitations. The call sign used must be one issued or permitted by the Regulatory Authority of the station location.
4. Remote receivers outside of the station location are not permitted.
5. Only one signal on a band is allowed at any time. When two or more transmitters are present on the same band, a hardware device MUST be used to prevent more than one signal at any one time. Alternating CQs on two or more frequencies on a band is not permitted.
6. Cross-mode, cross-band, or repeater (including satellite) contacts are not allowed.
7. Correction of logged call signs and exchanges after the contest, by use of any database, recordings, email or other methods, is not allowed.
8. Call signs logged must be the same as those exchanged over the air by the entrants during the QSO.

**Please direct all questions regarding the contest to Abigail Gold, KB6EE, and Zhenhao Yang, KN8U, YARC Contest Directors, at [contests@yarc.world](mailto:contests@yarc.world).**
