The Young Amateurs Radio Club (YARC) is a non-profit, international youth group with a focus on promoting the adoption and use of amateur radio among the youth. The YARC board manages the online chat group known as the YARC Discord server, hosts activities with a focus on youth participation, and is recognized by the FCC as an amateur radio club under the callsign WY4RC.

Becoming a YARC member is free, and allows you apply to use the WY4RC callsign to represent the club in contests, and get other cool benefits from our sponsors.

## History

In October of 2017, former YARC President David (KF1SHY) submitted a post titled ["Discord for young hams"](https://redd.it/73urv5) to the [/r/amateurradio](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/) subreddit.

David noticed the lack of a strong, active youth community in amateur radio, and hoped to create one. Within a week, the server had nearly 100 members, as it quickly became a popular place for young operators to meet. After a month, a mod team formed, and the server began to host weekly nets on Echolink.
