The Young Amateurs Radio Club (YARC) is a non-profit, international youth group with a focus on promoting the adoption and use of amateur radio among the youth. The YARC board manages the online chat group known as the YARC Discord server, hosts activities with a focus on youth participation, and is recognized by the FCC as an amateur radio club under the callsign WY4RC.

Becoming a YARC member is free, and allows you apply to use the WY4RC callsign to represent the club in contests, and get other cool benefits from our sponsors.

## History

In October of 2017, David Mosden (KF1SHY) submitted a post titled “Discord for young hams” to the /r/amateurradio subreddit.

Recognizing that amateur radio is generally dominated by an older population, David hoped to create a strong, active youth community in the hobby. The Discord server David had created, aptly named "Young Hams", quickly became a popular place for young operators to meet.
Within a few months, a leadership team would form that aided in creating events and activities for the community, including nets, contests, and general moderation of the server. By March of 2018, the community would be officially recognized by the FCC as an official amateur radio club under the call sign WY4RC.

In August of 2019, David stepped down as President of the board. The current board can be found below.
